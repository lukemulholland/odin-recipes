        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Burgers are the ideal weekend lunch. Follow my recipe for a quick and easy lunchtime treat that everyone will love.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (80/20 fat ratio is recommended for juiciness)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 hamburger bun per burger</li>
            <li>Optional: Lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, gently combine ground beef, salt, and pepper. Avoid overworking the meat, as this can make the burgers tough.</li>
            <li>Divide the meat mixture into equal portions and form them into patties slightly wider than your hamburger buns. Make a dimple in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent them from puffing up while cooking.</li>
            <li>Heat a grill or pan over medium-high heat. If using a grill, lightly oil the grates. Cook the patties for 3-4 minutes per side, or until desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the patty should read 160°F (71°C) for medium-rare.</li>
            <li>While the burgers are cooking, toast the hamburger buns if desired. You can toast them on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
            <li>Assemble your burgers! Place the cooked patty on the bottom bun, then add your favorite toppings. Top with the other half of the bun and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
