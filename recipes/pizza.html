        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza can be tricky to master but an absolute crowd pleaser. Follow these easy steps to impress everyone at your next dinner party</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><b>For the dough:</b>
            <li>500 grams (about 4 cups) all-purpose flour (or 00 flour, preferred for pizza dough)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>300 ml (1 ¼ cup) warm water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><b>For the toppings:</b>
            <li>(340g) Can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>200 grams (about 7 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol><b>Making the dough:</b>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, activate the yeast by dissolving it in warm water with a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy.</li>
            <li>Pour the yeast mixture and olive oil into the well in the flour mixture. Gradually combine the wet and dry ingredients with a spoon or your hands until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour if the dough feels too sticky.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover it with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol><b>Preparing the pizza:</b>
            <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting (ideally around 450°C or 850°F) for at least 30 minutes, with a pizza stone or baking sheet placed inside to preheat as well.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 12-inch circle. You can use a rolling pin or your hands to stretch the dough.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough round to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the crushed tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste. Spread the sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Add any other desired toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if using.</li>
        </ol>
